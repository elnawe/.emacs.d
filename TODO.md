# Things that need to get done in NEMACS

- Multi-monitor support
- GTD and ORG-MODE configuration
- Projects: Projectile+Org Publish for documentation (might fix this or change the name of the module)
- Maybe GNUs instead of mu4e?
- FIX issue with session closing before Emacs closes. New logout configuration.
