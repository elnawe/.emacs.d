# Things that need to get done in NEMACS

[X] Multi-monitor support
[ ] GTD and ORG-MODE configuration
[ ] Projects: Projectile+Org Publish for documentation (might fix this or change the name of the module)
[ ] Maybe GNUs instead of mu4e?
[ ] FIX issue with session closing before Emacs closes. New logout configuration.
[ ] Remove polybar in favor of a good modeline (Spaceline)
[ ] Define the theme
