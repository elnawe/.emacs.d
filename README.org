I am an enthusiastic Software Engineer who loves to work in a team,
sharing knowledge and experience among peers.
#+END_QUOTE

I started programming when I was 12 years old. I've been working on a
few open source projects as well as doing freelance. At the age of 23, I
started a professional career in Web Frontend, though I still prefer
more logical stuff instead of User Interface.

* Download This Configuration

My Emacs configuration has some personal touch even though lately I use
mostly a "stock Emacs". I use Terminal Emacs, so most of the colors are
adapted to how my terminals render Emacs.

** Download Emacs in Mac

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus --without-spacemacs-icon
